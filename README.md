# octyl

octyl is a WIP text editor for the terminal, written in Rust. It aims to provide a text editing experience akin to that of ![helix](https://helix-editor.com/) or ![vim](https://www.vim.org/), with features like plugins, text highlighting, modal editing, etc. This project is still well in it's infancy, so don't bully me about how bad it is.
