    Follow the existing code style in the project to maintain consistency.
    Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance readability.

### Commits

Keep commit messages clear and descriptive. Use present tense in commit messages (e.g., "Adds new feature" instead of "Added new feature"). Reference relevant issues or pull requests in your commits using keywords like "Fixes," "Closes," or "Resolves." 

### Testing

Whenever possible, include tests for your changes to ensure they work as intended. Run existing tests before submitting your changes to make sure you didn't break anything unintentionally.

### Pull Requests

Keep your pull requests focused on a single change or feature to facilitate faster and clearer code review. Be responsive to feedback and engage in discussions related to your pull request.
